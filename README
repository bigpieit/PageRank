This is the project for ECS230 Applied Numerical Linear Algebra at University of California, Davis.
Please read the Question.pdf for the questions I am going to answer about:
1) Implementation of Power Method to determine the dominant eigenvalue of matrix.
2) Implementation of Shifted Power Method to determine the eigenvalue of matrix.
3) Analysis to Shifted Power Method and PageRank Method and their applications for predicting chained web.

Please read through my Solution.pdf for detailed implementation of C code and analysis.
For any quesitons, please feel free to contact me at bxli@ucdavis.edu
Thank you!
